        <p>
            Performed a thermodynamic, geometric, and fatigue analysis of a simulated crankshaft and turbocharger shaft for a turbocharged engine. Used Excel/Sheets to analyze and iterate part dimensions and materials and used SolidWorks and hand calculations to perform and verify stress and fatigue analyses.

    </h3>
    <h4>
        <p>
            Development of theoretical multi-function hair styling tool starting from assessing requirements to SolidWorks drafting to low-fidelity prototyping and testing within a small team. User testing drove engineering requirements and therefore function and geometric design choices through use of ‘House of Quality’ QFD technique. Material, geometry, and electronic component selection was completed through ANSYS stress analysis, thermal analysis, and function diagram modeling.
